# Mac neovim Config setup

Yeah this config is pretty nice on mac 

### requirements/dependencies

```sh
brew install neovim && brew install ripgrep
```

Some of the fonts look better with iterm2 in my opinion 
```sh
brew install --cask iterm2
```

```sh
brew install node
```

(Optional) if you don't already have this installed :)
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
